    content="My wife asked me if there's any reason related to code architecture as to why companies make their clients click through all the steps whenever they edit their shipping info that is already completed, instead of just being able to click the appropriate section, edit the information, and go back to the summary page. I said I don't know, because I never made any of them, but I'll try making one to see if I can, and then I'll be able to answer."
